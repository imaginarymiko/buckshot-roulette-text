# Buckshot Roulette (text-based)

## Overview:
This is a (currently work-in-progress) text-based remake of the game Buckshot Roulette by Mike Klubnika, [available here](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette) as well as on Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/).<br>
It is similar to the game *Russian Roulette*.<br>
I am making this purely for educational purposes and not for any monetary gain.

## Installation:
Use the Makefile with `make`.

## Usage
`buckshot-roulette`
`buckshot-roulette <>`

## Help
At the beginning of each round, the shotgun will be loaded with a certain number of live and blank shells in a random order. The player will choose to shoot either the opposing player (or Dealer) or themselves. 

## To-do:
* Implement an intelligent AI that will play the game optimally.
* Potentially recreate the game using ncurses?
